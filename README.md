# BigData UC3M

This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments done in the course of the Master in Big Data Analytics at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. The projects are as variate as simple linear regressions to complex optimization examples using scipy optimize or Optuna. 

### List of Projects in this repository

* **AirBnB Madrid Data**
  - This folder contains two different parts of a bigger project based on the Statistical Learning course. The dataset used for the whole project is about AirBnB listings in Madrid. The first part of the project is purely descriptive and pre-procesing of the data (missing values, outliers and scaling/formatting the data). The second part of the project is based on supervised and unsupervised clustering methods. 
* **HousePrice Modelling**
  - This is a project done for a machine learning course in which we entered a Kaggle competition and used some regression techniques to get the best predictions of house prices. For this end we used both desicion trees and KNN models and trained them using HyperParameter tunning methods like SciPy optimize or Optuna. 
* **K means in Python and R**
  - In this folder there are several scripts showing ways of doing a k-means clustering by using different parallelization techniques in both Python and R. This was done as an example to compare the different methods and see which ones are better.
* **Optimization Models** 
  - This was done as part of a project for optimization techniques. I coded several methods such as the newton's method, the bisection method and many others and did a comparisson between performace in terms of number of iterations, time ellapsed and tolerance. 
* **Parallelization with Python**
  - In this folder there are 3 scripts comparing the performance of the code based on different types of parallelization such as threads and multiprocesses.
* **Predictive Modelling**
  - This is a folder that contains a project done for a statistics class. We did several assignments and used different methods to solve problems like digits image recognition and performed some examples of tunning the R^2 of a regression falsely.
* **Vaccine Delivery**
  - This project was done as part of an optimization problem to try to find the most optimal way of delivering the vaccines to different cities around Spain. I used two different methods of optimization, and the results are presented.
* **Wind Energy Predictions**
  - This is a purely machine learning example. The assignment was about trying out different ensemble techniques to get the best possible model. Methods such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, nearest newighbours, and optimized gradient boosting techniques like Light-Boosting were used and compared. The whole process of pre-processing, training, HP tunning, testing and evaluating the model is described inside.
* **Wind Energy Predictions using Spark**
  - This is a very similar project as the one above, just that in this case we have used Spark and its functions to develop the most precise model. We have done a PC analysis and compared its solutions using a linear regression.
* **DeepLearning**
  - Several PyTorch Projects and tutorials done in class with neural networks. Inside this folder we have RNN, CNN and DNN. Some of these are dedicated to image and text recognition.
